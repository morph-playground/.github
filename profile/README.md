## Playground

This organization is a made up codebase for testing software migrations.
It is a simple SaaS for task management built using microservice architecture.

Main user cases are around task management. 
Users can create projects, tasks, comment on tasks, receive notifications and many other features.

## Migration tasks

### Clean up console.log (easy)

### Permission service evolution (easy)

### Permission service evolution (hard)

The company is moving to multi-tenant setup. This means we need to re-work how we evaluate permissions.
Infra team has already implemented authentication and they add new `identity-tenant-id` header in the api-gateway.

The owners of `permission-service` have already implemented a new endpoint `/v2/check` 
that can accept `tenantId` along with existing `subjectId`.

So now all the other components need to be updated to the new version of permission-service.
But all the feature teams are busy with building a new shiny AI integration and can not prioritize this upgrade.

The only hope is you.

Bonus points - permission service is a messy copy-paste code so it reuses the same
